<br>What do people need? Discovering user needs will help you figure out how the product should be built, because it will generate evidence, validation and invalidation for various product features.

<br>
<br>Uncover objective needs
<br>Provides evidence-based feature generation
<br>Highlights pain points and delights - bringing you closer to offering product that meets their needs
<br>Gives inspiration for the new ideas - uncovers other viewpoints

<br>
<br>Nikdy sa nepýtaj priamo, či by za produkt platili alebo ho používali. Humans are very bad at predicting their future behavior. Ak sa správne spýtaš, budeš vedieť, what they currently pay for, how they currently behave, and how painful certain needs are for them. These will give you strong indications of whether they might pay for it or make a habit of using it.

<br>
<br>To uncover needs about buying shoes, instead of asking "The last time you went to a shoe store, what did you do?", be more specific about it: "The last time you went to a shoe store, what frustrated you the most about buying shoes?"
<br>7
<br>
<br>Questions to ask about behavior that is not repetitive:
<br>- what annoyed you the most last time you did...?
<br>- what is the primary reason for choosing your most recent vacation destination?
<br>- which laptop did you buy recently?
<br>8
<br>
<br>Nikdy sa nepýtaj na average behavior alebo too general.
<br>Je to pasca, ak pravidelne cestujem, namiesto posledných frustrácií odpoviem o všeobecných frustráciach, ktoré nemusia nereprezentovať skutočné dôvody. Vyhneš sa pasci tak, že otázku spojíš s posledným výskytom, kedy sa stala - last time. Dostaneš odpoveď zo živej pamäti, namiesto odpovede, ktorá ťa má uspokojiť.
<br>Vyhni sa všeobecným otázkam a namiesto celej témy sa pýtaj len na jej určitý aspekt.
<br>Q: What did you do last time in shop? ->What was the biggest challenge for you the last time you went to the grocery store?
<br>Q: How do you decide what to buy? ->What is the most important consideration for deciding what to buy the last time you went to store?
<br>9
<br>#
<br>
<br>Nikdy sa nepýtaj Yes/No questions.
<br>You'll have nothing actionable from results. You don't identify needs.
<br>Q: Would you prefer to do your grocery shopping online to save time? -> What was tge reason you recently grocery shopped online?
<br>9
<br>
<br>Nikdy sa nepýtaj na čísla.
<br>Ľudia si presné hodnoty častokrát nepamätajú. Môže zavádzať: nestalo sa - no need, velakrát sa opakuje - there is a need. Čísla nikdy neodhalia potreby, treba ísť hlbšie.
<br>10
<br>#
<br>
<br>Q: What would make finding items easier?
<br>Asks for opinion and predictions in future. Not helpful in identifying needs

<br>Research participants: nie príliš málo, ale ani moc veľa, aby si výsledky vedel spracovať. Ideálne od 25 - 200.

<br>
<br>Screening questionnare (screener):
<br>Dotazník so základnými údajmi a doplňujúcimi otázkami. Ak si chcem vyselektovať ľudí, položím otázky ako what's your age, what phone do you have, how often do you go on an airplane...ak odpovie neželane, vyškrtnem z interview.
<br>12
<br>
<br>Pred veľkým testom launch a pilot na malej vzorke ľudí. Make changes in case something doesn't work as expected. Also a chance that participants give you answers with enough level of detail.
<br>18
<br>
<br>- If people give you one-word answers, explain that you need to be sure you understand what they meant and ask to provide longer sentences as answers.
<br>- Encourage. Tell them you are very happy with their participation and level of detail they provided in their answers. Nechvál olich za konkrétne odpovede. Budú si myslieť, že to je to, čo chceš a budú sa snažiť dávať rovnaké odpovede a tebe uniknú ožitočné postrehy.
<br>- Zakaždým poďakuj za účasť. Niektorí ľudia prestanú spolupracovať, ak ich snaha nie je ocenená.
<br>18
<br>#
<br>
<br>While analysing the data epiminate incomprehensible or irrelevat answers. Nesnaž sa pochopiť nejasné, nedokončené alebo odveci odpovede. Ignoruj ich, je v poriadku, že nie všetky odpovede vieš použiť.
<br>19
<br>
<br>Getting picky and perfectionist, especially in late stages is a form of self-sabotage.

<br>Persona - a communication tool to align development and other teams with different types of users. Great way to raise empathy towards users.
<br>38
<br>
<br>Je v poriaku, ak persony vytvoríš podľa assumptions a časom ich potvrdíš alebo vyvrátiš. Ale vytvárať persony a používať ich mimo výskumu je chyba.
<br>38
<br>
<br>Začni s tým, že si vytvoríš personu a nazveš ju bullshit persona. Ak vynecháš prieskum, tak zostane bullshitom.

<br>
<br>Answers feom interviewing:
<br>- What are the different lifestyles of potential product users?
<br>- What motivates users to do....?
<br>- Which users I should focus on?
<br>- What's the users workflow?
<br>- What are right requirements fir the workflow?
<br>39
<br>
<br>Personas:
<br>- What are primary characteristics of your target users?
<br>- Are there different groups of users?
<br>- Is there a particular group that is more important than others?
<br>- Who are the early adopters of product?
<br>41
<br>
<br>Q: Can we take a look (at your email account) together?
<br>- Let interviewee be your guide
<br>
<br>Q: What did you do last time you got ready for a trip?
<br>- To understand workflows
<br>
<br>Q: Please demonstrate exactly how you did that.
<br>- To encourage to describe behavior when a specific task is given. One of the best questions
<br>
<br>Q: What do you think would happen if...? What makes you say that?
<br>- Asking about hypothetical future situation to understand values and expectations
<br>
<br>Q: Whom do you think would use something like that? For whom would this be inappropriate?
<br>- Identification questions to understand opinions
<br>
<br>Q: How would you describe (feature, activity) to someone? What advice would you give to somebody who was thinking about trying that?
<br>- to expose perspective, to reveal how they understand, what resonates in them.
<br>
<br>Q: So, in that situation, you would...
<br>- Technique adapted from journalism, especially TV interviews. Powerful to make interviewee want to fill the void created by silence with a good answer
<br>
<br>Q: If you had three wishes to make this - better for you, what would they be?
<br>- To understand pain points
<br>52
<br>#
<br>
<br>Follow-up questions:
<br>Vytiahmu odpovede, ktoré chceš
<br>Q: So, what I hear you saying is ... Is that right?
<br>Q: Can you tell me more about it?
<br>54
<br>
<br>Build an arc. Interview začni s jednoduchými otázkami, na ktoré je jednoduché odpovedať (kedy si naposledy použil telefón). Postupne prechádzaj k dôležitejším, vrátane follow-up questions. Záver odlahči jednoduchými otázkami a zaďakuj.
<br>54
<br>
<br>Sprav si priority. Zaznač si najdôležitejšie otázky, na ktoré chceš odpovede.
<br>54
<br>
<br>Leading questions - snaž sa ich neutralizovať
<br>Q: Would you like to use the current version or this new, improved one?
<br>- words such as new or improved lead that person to support you and say good things.
<br>Q: What do you think about that?
<br>- they don't always pay attention or think about different things. Makes them to think about something they wouldn't have neccesarily think about and to give unnatural, biased answers. However, its ok as a follow-up.
<br>Q: Show me how you'd responsed to that message.
<br>- biases to response, while in real life, they wouldn't do so.
<br>Netlač do otázky svoj názor - dobré, zlé, urobil by si,...
<br>55
<br>#
<br>
<br>Zlé otázky:
<br>- predikcia budúcnosti. Eliminate any question that starts with will or would. Radšej sa pýtaj, ako problém rieši teraz
<br>Q: Kúpil by si si to?
<br>- zložité otázky, privela otázok naraz. Rozbiť na jednofuchšie
<br>Q: Ako by si na to prišiel (discovered) a ako by si na to reagoval (responded)?

<br>Listen - show them you care
<br>Zaďakuj
<br>Vyzeraj príjemne

<br>Sample brief:
<br>Thanks
<br>- we appreciate that you joined us.
<br>Goal
<br>- we want to learn as much as possible from people who might use product we are working on. ...come up with a priduct that meets needs of you and people like you
<br>Procedure
<br>- ako to bude prebiehať
<br>Confidentiality
<br>- všetko ostane v tíme, s nikým to zdieľať nebudeme.
<br>Honest
<br>- stop me anytime with any comment, share anything what's on your mind
<br>Not a test of you
<br>- we are here to learn from you. There are no right or wrong answers. Your opinions are extremely useful for that
<br>Withdrawal - ak potrebuješ prestávku, náhle ukončiť, je to v pohode
<br>Otázky
<br>- máš otázky, predtým než začneme?
<br>61
<br>#
<br>
<br>Observation:
<br>- identifying new features or product
<br>- validating assumptions
<br>- understanding user goals
<br>- understanding people's workflows
<br>78
<br>
<br>Bad surveys ask questions about future behavior - would you use? How much would you pay? How did you solve this problem?
<br>Good surveys ask about facts - How old are you? On a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 is extremely dissatisfied and 7 is extremely satisfied, how satisfied were you from the check-out process in your last visit to a grocery store?
<br>79
<br>#
<br>
<br>When you first came up with the idea for your app, how did you know people really needed it?
<br>- to understand and learn about state of mi d of target audience
<br>- being aware of pain points of the audience
<br>
<br>You can ask people what they WANT. They have no idea what they're talking about. They sound believable but they're not. They're not bad nor liars. They have no clue but want to be helpful.
<br>- they must know about the product.
<br>- they must understand it's value
<br>- they must agree to it's cost

<br>Čím viac budeš vedieť o tom, čo ľudoa chcú, o to memej redundantného kódu, hodín irrelevantných meetingov a negatívnych emócii v tíme z toho, že mrhali svojou krvou, potom a slzami na niečo, čo nikto nechce.
<br>143
<br>
<br>Odpovedať na to, čo ľudia chcú, sa dá MVP alebo Fake Doors Experiment.
<br>
<br>MVP
<br>- slúži tímu na zbieranie informácií o tom, čo ľudia chcú s minimálnou námahou.
<br>- Most likely to quickly invalidate an assumption.
<br>- not a version 1
<br>- prototyp s minimálnou funkcionalitiou na testovanie so subsetom userov to avoid building something people don't want.
<br>- nie je minimálny produkt s minimom funkcií
<br>- think of it as series of experiments and research activities with the goal to helping you learn.
<br>144

<br>
<br>Účinnosť fake doors:
<br>- kamenný obchod si spraví stránku s CTA download shopping app
<br>- powerful decision making tool
<br>- vyhnúť sa riziku drahého vývoja
<br>- keep you from delivering features nobody wants
<br>- make you start speaking the language that resonates with customers and perfect it
<br>- how should i persuade people to try?
<br>- would people pay? How much?
<br>- who is the audience?
<br>147
<br>#
<br>
<br>Risks of MVP:
<br>- measuring wrong metric
<br>- customer disbelief
<br>- execution issues, difficulties in crafting a good prototype
<br>- wrong customers
<br>149
<br>
<br>Pulitch your MVP to potential customers. Its an important aspect to meet them and understand their perceltion about product's value.
<br>152
<br>
<br>A head-banger problem is a problem you need to solve yet you never realuzed it before someone experienced it.
<br>It's so obvious that you bang head agaimst a wall, not understanding how you could have missed it.
<br>155
<br>
<br>At certain point in time if things are going smoothly, ask customers to pay for the service. Tell tgem the service will become premium. Offer them good deal since they are kind to help you. If they are willing to pay, excellent! Signals show its what they need. If not, get down to the root cause of their resistance - why.
<br>155
<br>
<br>If you ask for payment, you gather behavioral data, asking "would you" you are collecting attitudinal data that will mislead you since people have no idea what they would do in future.
<br>They want to be nice and helpful, and they will tell you they would pay for it.
<br>155
<br>
<br>Fake Doors.
<br>Misleading research wasting time, wrong and unreliable - Landing page to collect emails to see if people need product.
<br>That only answers the question "Are people interested enough to give us their email address?". You learn nothing what they want and need.
<br>157
<br>#
<br>
<br>Humans have no idea what they need and will always be kind to people who ask them. It doesn't cost much to say it's a great idea.
<br>157
<br>
<br>Fake Doors as a button to nowhere:
<br>button to indicate feature behind it. After clicking it shows a coming soon or in progress note. Don't be nasty just because you want to learn. Have the courtesy to admit it and apologize for not having the product available. Thank them for helping you know their needs, if you can, give them small gift as a gusture to compensate them.
<br>158
<br>#
<br>
<br>Experiments are mostly about learning that tge idea has failed. Customers don't provide a clear signal they want to use the lroduct.
<br>This is where founders and PMs make bad decisions. They ignore what they learnt and chase their passion for making product out of their idea.
<br>159
<br>#
<br>
<br>When you get frustrated that people don't want your product, ghen change and test it. That's innovation, design thinking, UX.
<br>159
<br>
<br>When I hear that you launched your app in two weeks, then it's almost certainly a request for a disaster check. Maybe you could do some usability testing.

<br>
<br>There's no such a thing as perfect design. Great design is hard to create, and no design is great at first attempt.
<br>173
<br>
<br>A usable product can be ugly and a beautiful product unusable. Studies have shown that beautiful product have percieved as more usable than ugly ones.
<br>Ak to nevieš spraviť pekné, sprav to hlavne použiteľné.
<br>174
<br>
<br>Ak je použiteľnosť zlá, tak ju zlepši, lebo inak si ľudia budú myslieť, že product idea je zlá.
<br>174
<br>
<br>The myth is that people should be asked if they can use product when it's almost ready, in a good shape, well-designed. The opposite is true. They should be asked when it's not ready, ugly, when you're ashamed to show it to people. That's the time when you can learn about issies they have and have enough time and resources to fix them.
<br>175
<br>
<br>Validácia:
<br>- kvalitatívna. Zopár ľudí, pozorujem, ako produkt používajú, čo im robí problémy.
<br>- kvantitatívna. Stovky ľudí, namiesto pozorovania každého dostanem čísla, ktoré mi povedia, čo sa stalo.
<br>Ideálne skombinovať.
