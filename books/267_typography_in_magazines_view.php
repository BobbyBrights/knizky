<br>V rozhlasovej hre máš veľa postáv, ktoré sa v nej objavujú. Všetky sú rozdielne osobnosti s odlišnými vlastnosťami. Keďže ich nevidíš, jediný spôsob, ako ich rozlišuješ  je podľa farba ich hlasu, prízvuk, spôsob, ako rozprávajú.
<br>Presne takto funguje aj písmo (type).

<br>You could read a magazine of a language you don't know jhlust by lookimg at the type treatment: the size, the chosen typeface, the color, is there an underline, a decoration?
<br>All those things are sounds of a radio show, telling us who's the good guy, the bad guy or the girl in the story.

<br>
<br>In that place where photograpgers, architects, graphic designers of all kinds have moved away  from their initial creations and have behun to think like artists, at a point where artists have decided to stroll around museums and art gallery atmospheres and have absorbed all the new trends and begun to think like real artists.

<br>Some ask themselves is this art or commercial art? Elephant (magazine) says: Who cares?

<br>
<br>The interplay of typography, layout and image is what gives personality to magazine combined with an origonal use of color.

<br>
<br>Dealing with different themes published in the form of topics of interest, the magazines explores a wide range of sectors that may be of potential interest to graphic artists (fonts, images, photographs, title sequences, video design, digital media).

<br>
<br>Ink explores graphic design like a field of search and creation.
<br>62
<br>
<br>Ink is like a playground for its creators to experiment.
<br>62
<br>
<br>The name of the magazine, ink, is part of tgat day and experiment. After drinking and having finished the first issue, its creators still had no name for magazine. When they awoke next morning with a terrible hangover, someone saw a short description on an ink certridge, and it was when the word ink appeared as a revelation.
<br>62
<br>
<br>All viable changes are considered and dealt without fear, there's nothing established , nothing to regret, no intention of making ink the perfect issue. Each issue can be better than the last, everything always can be better.

<br>
<br>Mark is a magazine created, run by and for lovers of architecture.
<br>96
<br>
<br>Mark is also a name and this made them think that this could help them start a more personal relationship with readers. This idea is used in the magazine, in an article that appears in every issue called Dear Mark, where a writer offers a personal letter about the architecture of a certain city.

<br>The New York Times Magazine, since 1896, the year when it was founded, has boasted about an excellent high level in journalism, art and photography.

<br>
<br>All corners are given the same attention as they are considered to be equally important and that is what gives balance to the magazine.
<br>114
<br>
<br>The philosophy or idea behind this is that the typography chosen fits perfectly, not only with the tonebut also with the story content.
<br>114
<br>#
<br>
<br>Appearing twice a year, each issue shows us new creations from wide choice of artists and creators from the world of fine arts, design, high fashion and culture.
<br>122
<br>
<br>Then they stay with the work that the artist, designer or photographer has done, or they work together with him or her to achieve harmony.
<br>122
<br>
<br>Other custom made types are responsible for illustrating the front cover of different sections in an attempt to give a personal touch to the work.

<br>
<br>In order to improve with each issue, they are aware that they run the risk of the readernot easily identiftlying the publication when there are significant changes affecting the aesthetics.
<br>But if they want to improve the appearance of the magazinethen that is a risk that must be taken.
<br>123
<br>
<br>By being able to separate all pages individually, each section of the magazine can be hung on the wall as if it was a work or art.

<br>
<br>Thus the various aspects involved in the development of this project are equally important, forming an equilateral triangle between typography, layout and image. Why? Simply because the readers enjoy the possibility of all sides of that triangle.
<br>149
<br>
<br>Then there is a sharing, where content is examined and decisions are taken about pending aspects, about the direction that a specific issue should take, etc. This means paying special attention to design details, evolving and changing with each issue but, at the same time, using very simple methods to achieve it, like using the most basic standard fonts, Arial, Times New Roman or Courier New.

<br>
<br>Pages often have to communicate a large amount of information, which provides a very specific challenge.
