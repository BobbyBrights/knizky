<br>- Focus on how they see the world, how they argue a particular point. To understand what they want
<br>- Start collecting their jargon, specific words they use to describe the problem

<br>
<br>People get one potential customer  and they think: All right, I'm going to make this product. That's really a recipe for failure.
