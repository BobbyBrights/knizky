<br>I love uniforms! Because if there's nothing there, clothes are certainly not going to make the man. It's better to always wear the same thing and know that people are liking you for the real you and not the you your clothes make.

<br>My father was away a lot on business trips to the coal mines, so I never saw him very much. My mither would read to me in her thick Czechoslovakian accent as best as she could and O would always say Thanks, Mom, after she finished with Dick Tracy, even if I hadn't umderstood a word.

<br>When I think of my high school days, all I can remember, really, are the longwalks to school, through the Czech ghetto with the babushkas and overalls on their clotheslines, in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

<br>The location of my studio was great - 47th Street and Third Avenue. We'd always see demonstrators on their way to UN for all the rallies. The Pope road by on 47th Street once on his way to St. Patrick's. Khrushchev went by once, too. It was a good wide street.

<br>
<br>The subculture, pop, stuperstars, drugs, lights, discothèques. There was always party somewhere. People were always getting dressed up for a party. All Tommorow's Parties was the name of a song the Velvets used to do at the Dom when the Lower East Side was beginning to shake off its immigrant status and get hip. What costumes shall the poor girl wear/To all tomorrow's parties.

<br>Všetko bolo extravagantné. Musel si byť bohatý, aby si si dovolil pop clothes z butikov alebo od designerov ako Tiger Morse. Tiger vedela kúpiť kostým za 2 doláre, odtrhnúť mašľu a vo svojom obchode predať za 400. 
<br>Rovnako aj s accessories. Len niečo prišilaa predala to za 50. 
<br>Mala talent rozoznať, či si niekto chce niečo kúpiť. Jednej bohato vyzerajúcej pani hneď povedala, že pre ňu nemá nič, čo by ju mohlo zaijímať.

<br>I never wanted to make simply sex movies. If I had wanted to make a real sex movie I would have filmed a flower giving birth to another flower. And the best love story is just two love-birds in a cage.

<br> 
<br>Ak vidíš niekoho, kto vyzerá presne ako tvoj vysnený ideál, srejme to nie je tvoj ideál (fantasy), ale niekto, kto sa nevzdal snov a išiel do obchodu a kúpil si veci, ktoré on a ty máte tak radi.

<br>I'm fascinated by boys who spend their lives trying to be complete girls, getting rid of all the tell-tale signs and drawing in all the female signs. I'm not saying it's a right thing to do, I'm not saying it's not self-defeating and self-destructive, and I'm not saying it's a posdibly the most absurd thing a man can do with his life.
<br>What I'm saying its a hard work. It's a hard work to look like exact opposite of what nature made you and then to be an imitation of woman of what was only a fantasy woman in the first place.

<br>I really spoil myself in the food area, so my leftovers are often grand - my hairdresswr's cat eats pâté twice a week.
<br>My leftovers usually turn up to be meat, because I'll buy a huge piece of meat, cook it up for dinner, and then right before it's done I'll break down and have what I wanted in the first place - bread and jam.

<br>In Europe the royalty and the aristocracy used to eat a lot better than peasants. Each class was stuck to its own food. But when Queen Elisabeth came here and President Eisenhower bought her a hot dog I'm sure he felt confident she couldn't have delivered  to Buckimgham Palace a better hot dog that he bought her for 20 cents at the ballpark. No for a dollar, not for a hundred thousand dollars could get her a better hot dog. She could get one for 20 cents and so could anyone else.

<br>Raz som išiel na aukciu do Parke-Benett, ale nechceli ma pustiť, lebo som mal v ruke hot dog. Tak som povedal priateľovi, že počkám vonku a medzitým som v lobby rozdával autogramy. It was a really American situation to be in.

<br>When I was a child I had a fantasy about having candy. As I matured that fantasy translate itself into "make money to have candy", because as you get older, of course, you get more realistic. Then, after my third nervous breakdown and I still didn't have that extra candy, my career started to pick up and I started getting more and more candy.

<br>Old buildings are unnatural spaces. Buildings should be built for a short time. If they're older 10 years, I say get rid of them. Building and tearing down would keep people busy and the water wouldn't be rusty from old pipes.
