<br>I love uniforms! Because if there's nothing there, clothes are certainly not going to make the man. It's better to always wear the same thing and know that people are liking you for the real you and not the you your clothes make.

<br>My father was away a lot on business trips to the coal mines, so I never saw him very much. My mither would read to me in her thick Czechoslovakian accent as best as she could and O would always say Thanks, Mom, after she finished with Dick Tracy, even if I hadn't umderstood a word.

<br>When I think of my high school days, all I can remember, really, are the longwalks to school, through the Czech ghetto with the babushkas and overalls on their clotheslines, in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

<br>The location of my studio was great - 47th Street and Third Avenue. We'd always see demonstrators on their way to UN for all the rallies. The Pope road by on 47th Street once on his way to St. Patrick's. Khrushchev went by once, too. It was a good wide street.

<br>The subculture, pop, stuperstars, drugs, lights, discothèques. There was always party somewhere. People were always getting dressed up for a party. All Tommorow's Parties was the name of a song the Velvets used to do at the Dom when the Lower East Side was beginning to shake off its immigrant status and get hip. What costumes shall the poor girl wear/To all tomorrow's parties.

<br>Všetko bolo extravagantné. Musel si byť bohatý, aby si si dovolil pop clothes z butikov alebo od designerov ako Tiger Morse. Tiger vedela kúpiť kostým za 2 doláre, odtrhnúť mašľu a vo svojom obchode predať za 400. 
<br>Rovnako aj s accessories. Len niečo prišilaa predala to za 50. 
<br>Mala talent rozoznať, či si niekto chce niečo kúpiť. Jednej bohato vyzerajúcej pani hneď povedala, že pre ňu nemá nič, čo by ju mohlo zaijímať.

<br>My wife. When i say we, I mean my tape recorder and me. A lot of people don't understand that.

<br>Fantasy love is much better than real love. Never doing is a very exciting. The most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet.

<br>I never wanted to make simply sex movies. If I had wanted to make a real sex movie I would have filmed a flower giving birth to another flower. And the best love story is just two love-birds in a cage.

<br>One of the older superstars used to cry every time somebody she loved kicked her out of his loft, and I used to tell her: Don't worry. You're going to be very famous someday and you'll be able to buy him.
