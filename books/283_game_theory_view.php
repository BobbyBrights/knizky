<br>Game: you have to take into account the objectives and strategies of another players.
<br>Interests, what they know, what motivates them, what they know about you.

<br>Each person acts in their interest and the result is a disaster for group.
<br>- if mice could tie a bell on cat's neck it would be great, but whi would do that?

<br>Rock paper scissors - the point is not to be predictable
<br>
<br>Different games have identical mathematical forms (trees, tables). Thinking about them in such forms makes it easy to transfer knowledge from one situation to another.
<br>39
<br>
<br>When you try to put yourself into another players' shoes, you have to know what they know and don't know what they don't.
<br>They objectives have to be your objectives, not what you wish they had as objectives.

<br>Prisoner' dilema 
<br>- facing two options which both lead to result that's bad for everyone - two prisoners: if one confesses the other had better confess to avoid really harsh sentence. If one holds out, the other can cut himself better sentence by confessing. Temptation to confess exists (as well as to be first who drips prices in price war)
<br>- eg price wars
<br>- dominant strategy: if a strategy is better than all other available strategy and ni matter what strategy other players choose
<br>-if you have dominant strategy, use it
<br>- when both players have dominant strategies, they both do worse than they would have agreed that each would choose other dominated strategies ( obchodníci by spravili lepšie, keby sa na cenách vopred dohodli ako keď by sa mali podliezať v cenovej vojne)
<br>65
<br>
<br>Tit for tat - oko za oko, zub za zub - wrong strategy because it leads to chain reaction (no one knows who started first), lacks enough is enough.

<br>
<br>How to achieve cooperation.
<br>Punishment:
<br>- detection of cheating: before cheating can be punished it must be detected. If detection is fast and accurate, the punishment is fast and accurate. If detection is slow and inaccurate, temptation to cheat is raised.
<br>- clarity: if boundaries of acceptable behavior and consequences of cheating are complex and confusing, players may cheat by mistake or fail to make a rational calculation
<br>- certainity: players should have confidence that defection will be punished and cooperation rewarded (problem in WTO - if a country raises complains, administrative process takes years, judgement depends on diplomacy and international politics anyway)
<br>- size: there are always errors in practice. The punishment should be kept as low as it's compatible with successful deterrence in most circumstances. It may be optional to forgive occasional defection in some extreme situations
<br>
<br>Prisoner's dillema v praxi: kartelizácia a monopolizácia. Dohoda prináša viac ako jej porušenie (machinery, gas,...)
<br>Instead of agreeing on price, the firms can agree on division of the market (geography, product line, ...)
<br>92
<br>
<br>Tragedies of the commons 
<br>- temptation of fishermen to catch more than assigned quota and ruin ecosystems.
<br>94
<br>
<br>No amount of monitoring or sanctioning reduces the temptation to zero. Instead of thinking of conquering tragedies of the commons, effective governance systems cope better than others.
<br>97
<br>
<br>Meeting someone without instructions - focal point is strategic (think what they would think is the best place). In experiments finding someone (just knowing they are looking for you) in big city without specified time has high success rate.
<br>- stock market: you want to buy stock that will rise up in price. Hot stock is the stock that everyone thinks that everyone else thinks... is the hot.
<br>113
<br>
<br>All players agree in preferring equilibrium outcome to a non equilibrium outcome, but they disagree which equilibrium is better.
<br>(Chicken game: teenagers driving toward each other on straight road, who steers first to avoid collision is a loser(0,5). If they crash, the worst outcome for all(0). Winner(1) - if each player is trying to achieve their best equilibrium they end up in their worst outcome).
<br>118
<br>
<br>If a strategy A is uniformly worse than strategy B, then A is dominated by B.
<br>Elimination of strategies can open up a way to eliminate in second round.
<br>122
<br>
<br>Risky strategy won't always work, but it avoids the danger of set patterns and predictability.
<br>162
<br>
<br>Discount coupons - to expand market share. To attract new customers without giving discount to your existing market.
<br>If Coke and Pepsi offer simultaneously, customers have no incentive to switch brands. They stay and take the discount.
<br>The idea is to avoid promotion overlaps, what they do.
<br>162
<br>
<br>Randomized strategy - airlines offering last minute tickets. Won't tell you how many seats are left in order to help you estimate your chances of success. If last-minute ticket availability was more predictable, there would be a greater possibility of exploiting the system and losing more regular paying customers.
<br>163
<br>
<br>Parking penalties - choosing a random strategy is better than enforcing 100 percent which would be expensive (salaries, administration). 
<br>When rate is 25usd, a 1 in 25 risk of being caught is enough to keep you honest.
<br>164
<br>
<br>Random drug testing. Same. Uncover those unable to work and discover others. Chances are small penalties high.

<br>
<br>Air defense must be able to destroy almost 100 percent of missiles. A cost-effective solution for attacker is to use fake missiles as well. As long they cant distinguish, they have to destroy all.

<br>Janken game - japanese version of Rock Paper Scissors. Played on staircase. If I use paper to win, go 5 steps up. If scissors 2. 1 for rock.

<br>
<br>Strategic moves:
<br>- actions that change the game to ensure better outcome for player
<br>- what and how
<br>175
<br>
<br>Sometimes freedom to chose is freedom to lose - when another players force me to take only bad responses.
<br>176
<br>
<br>Price matching.
<br>Two stores selling luxurious shirts. Interest of both is to keep monopoly prices. Both have temptation to undercut to make a bigger profit for itself (prisoners dilema), if they start bidding the price, both lose.
<br>How can strategic moves resolve that. Setting prices in catalogs are simultaneous moves (can't observe what other one is doing). Store A can set high price and match lower prices of any competitors - won't lose its customers.
<br>182
<br>
<br>Strategic moves:
<br>1. Commitment ( unconditional first move, "just do that")
<br>2. Threat ( response on first move, action that hurts you)
<br>3. Promise ( response, action that rewards the other player)
<br>185
<br>
<br>Sometimes your goal is to prevent opponent from making unconditional statement.
<br>Sun Tzu: leave the enemy an escape route - to prevent from making commitment to fight to the death.
<br>188
<br>
<br>Threats don’t have deadline (don't do...ever), compellences must (clean your room by 5pm, othewise kid will defeat the purpose by procrastination - i have a training, will do tomorrow)
<br>Compellence is better achieved when it comes with reward.
<br>190
<br>
<br>Threats carry a risk of error, understanding these risk is crucial. Use them carefully, even with best care they may fail, while stakes are raising.
<br>197
<br>
<br>Stalin's regime motivated people to hard work by punishments - sending to gulag. Because system was inaccurate and corrupt, risks for being punished were almost same in any case. So why to work?
<br>
<br>Threat, commitment or promise will bring outcome only if they are credible. They must be given with purpose to change the game.
<br>202
<br>
<br>To turn threat into warning, a promise into assurance:
<br>- write contracts to back you up
<br>- establish and use reputation.
<br>(More reputation someone invests, more costly it is to break the commitment)
<br>204
<br>#
<br>
<br>To change the game by limiting your ability to back out of a commitment:
<br>- cut off communication
<br>- burn bridges behind you
<br>- leave outcome beyond your control, or even to chance
<br>
<br>If a large commitment is broken down into smaller ones, then the gain from breaking a little one may be more than offset by loss of the remaining contract.
<br>204
<br>#
<br>
<br>To help you maintain commitment:
<br>- a team achieves credibility more easier than individual.
<br>- or hire others to act in your behalf.
<br>204
<br>#
<br>
<br>Reputation - moves from previous games build you credibility for future moves
<br>210
<br>
<br>If you make a strong declaration about an action and you act contrary to it, your reputation can suffer irreplacable damage.
<br>212
<br>
<br>Where there's a will there's a way to make your startegy credible.
<br>212
<br>#
<br>
<br>Burn bridges - destroy any escape ways. For you or keep them for opponent. 
<br>In business: focus on one field/strenght and aggressively fight with anyone who challenges you.
<br>217
<br>
<br>Deterrence is an art of producing in the mind of enemy the fear of attack.
<br>- irrevocable and automated decisions to rule out human meddling
<br>-simple to understand, credible and convincing
<br>- film, kde ruské jadrové zbrane sa automaticky odpália, ak zaregistrujú americký útok
<br>199
<br>
<br>Small steps:
<br>- reduce commitment to small scale: 1M payment or 1000 payments of 1000
<br>- contract work
<br>- reduces size of threat and promise, scales commitment
<br>- strategic thinking: worry about last step. If you expect to be cheated in last round, break off the relationship one round earlier.
<br>-- to avoid unraveling of trust, there should be no clear final step. As long as there remains a chance of CONTINUOUS business, it will never be worthwhile to cheat
<br>219

<br>
<br>Teamwork:
<br>- although people might be weak on their own, they can build resolve by forming a group
<br>- rímska ríša: dezertujúci vojak musí byť zabitý. Ak vojak, ktorý vidí dezertovať a nezabije dezertéra, bude tiež zabitý
<br>- West Point, Priceton: exams are nit monitored. Cheating is an offence and leads to repulsion. Because students are not inclined to rat on others, failure to report is also a violation and leads to repulsion. Students report because they do not want to become guilty.
<br>219
<br>
<br>Negotiating agents
<br>- useful: when negotiating with someone with whom you share bonds of relationship. You may concede more for the sake of relationship. Impersonal agent is better to get you a better deal (sport teams, authors-publishers)
<br>- if agent is a leader of organisation his negotiating position is stronger, in some cases he doesn’t have an authority to compromise because he represents members
<br>- machine: if employees are required to follow rules mechanically (government clerks, stores), negotiating is above their grade. Who would argue with a vending machine?
<br>222
<br>#
<br>
<br>Undermining opponent's credibility
<br>- as you want to make your moves credible, you want to benefit from preventing other players to make their moves credible.
<br>- id you're a retailer negotiating a better price from supplier, you can credibly promise not to reveal this to rivals
<br>- you can try to destroy credibility of opponents threat by going against his wishes in small steps (Hitler) - salami tactics - one slice at time
<br>- you might refuse to talk to agent or ask to talk to manager
<br>224
<br>
<br>Actions speak louder than words. 
<br>Less money in hand is more than more in promise.
<br>
<br>Screening - to uncover information about other players
<br>Capital one - 40 percent growth over decade. Their offer by its nature is attractive only to profitable type of customers - they don’t know who they are, but offer screens out unprofitable types.
<br>247
<br>
<br>Screening:
<br>People often think of bureaucratic delays and inconviences as a proof of ineffeciency of government but they might be valuable strategies to cope with informational problems:
<br>- dotácie: if you give money to everyone who asks, you're going to get a lot of people
<br>- filling forms, waiting whole day for 5 min talk
<br>252
<br>
<br>Sometimes the most effective ways are the cheapest.
<br>
<br>Signalling - buying a car: if interior is clean, its likely it has been well looked after.
<br>Fake signal - its easy to clean it.
<br>257
<br>
<br>Confusing signals - lies
<br>Best lies arise when someone speaks truth in order not to be believed.
<br>259
<br>
<br>A good poker player must play at random and violate principles of correct game.
<br>
<br>Price discrimination
<br>Sellers do not exactly know how much each individual customer is willing to pay. To overcome this problem, the trick that sellers commonly use is to create different versions of the same good and price it differently. 
<br>But sellers set attributes and prices of each version that different types of consumers will choose different versions. 
<br>These actions implicitly reveal their willingness to pay. Sellers are screening buyers.
<br>#
<br>
<br>When a new product is released, there are people who are willing to pay more - need it, want to impress others.
<br>Others are willing to pay less and are content to wait.
<br>Books - publishers take advantage of that - books are published in hardcover, a year after in paperback.
<br>
<br>If no one obeys speed limit, you shouldn’t too:
<br>1. some experts argue its safer to drive at the speed of the flow
<br>2. smaller chance you get caught.

<br>Slippery slope - dangerous
<br>292
<br>#
<br>
<br>FAIL
<br>If you're going to fail, you might as well fail at a difficult task. Failure causes others to downgrade your expectations of you in the future.
<br>If other people's perception of your ability matters, it may be better for you that increase chance of failing to refuse its consequence. Who follows this strategy
<br>- people who apply to Harvard instead of local college
<br>- to ask influencer instead of most realistic prospect

<br>
<br>Uncoordinated choices produce poor outcomes for society.
<br>- each player acts in their interest.

<br>
<br>Auctions
<br>- you should bid until  you reach your valuation
<br>If you propose your intended for marriage, you should assume the answer is yes
<br>- seal bid auctions (sealed offers, price offers) - when putting down your bid you should always assume that other bidders are below your bid. Then ask whats your best bid. You will be often wrong. But doesn’t matter if you’re outbid. But if you win you made a correct assumption.

<br>Apple Newton - wait until you're fully ready and miss opportunity. Jump in too early and fail.

<br>War of attrition.
<br>Suffer to outlast competitor. Your cost for hanging on will be justified by the pot of gold to the winner.

<br>- very dangerous - best move - work out a deal with the other player
<br>
<br>Tacit cooperation:
<br>- when two games are combined into one, this creates an opportunity to employ strategies that go across games
<br>- simultaneous auctions - two auctions at the same time. coordinate bidding with opponent: each one wins one auction for minimal bid. 
<br>- expensive to win both auctions, cheap to win one for a fraction of price
<br>- as a seller: make auctions in a sequence
