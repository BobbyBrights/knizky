<br>Think about daily and weekly goals
<br>Every single day of work counts. Every individual should know what 
<br>their goals are for each day, how they relate to the team’s weekly goal 
<br>and how they relate to what is being released by the company.
<br>
<br>CREATE A CULTURE OF GOAL SETTING
<br>To ensure you stay focused and on track, set weekly goals for your 
<br>team. Daily and weekly goals are a great way of helping you prioritize.
<br>
<br>Iterate recently shipped products
<br>A common mistake most software companies make is shipping 
<br>something and moving on to the next shiny thing. But one of the truths 
<br>of building software is that you never fully get it right the first time. 
<br>This is universally true, no matter how hard you try and no matter how 
<br>much research you do. So we commit to making sure shipping is just 
<br>the beginning and then we iterate and make things better.
<br>
<br>If you believe every idea you present must look and sound great, 
<br>don’t be surprised if you have very few of them. If you have very few 
<br>don’t be surprised if you pick a bad one. When you pick a bad idea no 
<br>amount of iteration will make it great.

<br>PRICING
<br>We didn’t charge a single cent during Intercom’s first year - we were ready to think about the value we were delivering and how to charge for it.
<br>
<br>Initially we spent weeks dreaming up fancy pricing models, running the 
<br>numbers, analyzing our customer base to see who gets most value and 
<br>deciding what should be free. Jason Fried, 
<br>Co-Founder of Basecamp, and his advice was characteristically simple, “Just charge $50 and see what happens”.
<br>
<br>I worry about business products that charge just $9/month; it can give them a false 
<br>sense of traction. Their conversion and churn will look good, but only 
<br>because no one in any credible company even notices $9/month 
<br>on a company credit card. If the plan is to move that $9 to $59 when 
<br>things “get real”.
<br>Learnt more about user base - It helped us distinguish credible customers from folks who were just playing around.
<br>
<br>“Low pricing rules out lots of potential 
<br>customers for your product, in the same way serving $3 steaks in a restaurant actually restricts your clientele.”
<br>#
<br>
<br>Upravovať cenové plány je v pohode. Až dodatočne dostávaš viac informácií o zákazníkov, je správne prispôsobovať im plány.
<br>
<br>But you should start charging your customers as early as you can, 
<br>because it helps you discover the most important areas to focus on.
<br>
<br>1. Believing everyone should be happy to pay for your product
<br>2. Believing there is some mythical “perfect” price which 
<br>extracts maximum revenue from every single customer
<br>3. Believing product pricing can never be changed once established
<br>4. Delaying charging indefinitely as a result of 1, 2 and 3
<br>
<br>The key to selling your product is understanding the value it delivers to 
<br>your customers and then positioning it correctly based on that. 
<br>The same is true in the software industry. $29 a month sounds expensive 
<br>for “5GB of file storage” but great value for “the certainty of keeping your 
<br>family photos safe forever.” It’s about understanding why your customers 
<br>buy your product, and then positioning it properly.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Customers who don’t pay for software give different feedback from those that do, 
<br>and are the wrong people to take feedback from. As a rule of thumb, 
<br>feedback from non-paying users tends to focus on additions to the product. Feedback from paying customers focuses on improvements to the product you already have.
<br>###
<br>
<br>A lot of services include a “starter” plan for $5 or $9 per month. Usually that’s to reinforce the claim that the product is “affordable enough for 
<br>everyone”, while boosting your numbers.
<br>A customer on the $9 plan costs just as much to acquire and can cost as much to support as your customers on the top-tier $49 plan. 
<br>
<br>Worse yet, those tiny customers very rarely grow into higher priced tiers. 
<br>Small companies can grow into large customers, but more often they 
<br>remain a small customer paying the same amount forever. Many companies 
<br>have chosen to kill their lowest priced plan after realizing this, lowering 
<br>their support costs and increasing their revenue.
<br>
<br>HIRES
<br>You really have to like your first few 
<br>hires. In the best situation, they will become your lifelong friends. You’ll grow up together, get old together and share in success and failure together - hire people who share your fundamental values, who you feel very comfortable with and enjoy the company of.
<br>#
<br>
<br>WHO SHOULD YOU HIRE? EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE
<br>A company’s hiring process is usually a pretty good indicator of the 
<br>quality of people at the company. The higher the bar, the better 
<br>the talent, the more interesting the company.
<br>
<br>Exceptional people…are ambitious, and determined
<br>◊ They dream big and push themselves, you and your team, towards bigger achievements than you initially thought possible.
<br>◊ They have a growth mindset. They crave feedback and new challenges that will push them to grow. They they see effort as the path to mastery, and they’re inspired by and learn from the success of others.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Ambition is a ceiling to success. 
<br>#
<br>
<br>Great companies have huge ambition, 
<br>which initially comes from the founders, but is sustained and thrives with 
<br>the addition of ambitious people they hire. Ambitious and determined 
<br>people fight for impact and push for greatness. They outperform and 
<br>grow faster than people who may be more talented but lack an inner drive. Bet on them, and spend your time helping ambitious people grow.
<br>
<br>They know that greatness is achieved in 1,000 small steps. They also have a 
<br>long term vision of where the technology they own should evolve to.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Companies that don’t grow, die. The same 
<br>is true of people and teams. Hire people that fight for growth.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Positivity.
<br>A team that thinks it’s going to lose, will lose.
<br>
<br>Culture fit.
<br>Solely hiring people similar to your current team limits your company’s 
<br>capability and causes you to miss out on diverse ideas. 
<br>
<br>BE CLEAR ABOUT YOUR VALUES
<br>Candidates shouldn’t have to guess what 
<br>matters to you. It’s a poor interview if you’re left wondering
<br>
<br>Intercom value: “Every day counts”. 
<br>Our competitors are constantly improving. The market continues to expect more. 
<br>
<br>Zappos culture:
<br>- offer employee 2000 usd if they quit in the first week - to avoid bad matches
<br>
<br>“Why does our company exist other than to make money?”
<br>
<br>So, what actions can you actually take to focus on company culture? 
<br>
<br>◊ Practice random acts of workplace happiness
<br>◊ Hire positive people
<br>◊ Stop negative behavior 
<br>◊ Celebrate success
<br>◊ Celebrate mistakes
<br>
<br>Question whether or not a person is a great addition to team culture. That doesn’t mean you’re looking for carbon copies of your 
<br>founding team. Only hiring people similar to your current team won’t improve how you work, and limits your entire company’s capability. 
<br>Every team has cultural blind spots they’re unaware of, and you’ll likely 
<br>find yourself biased in unexpected ways. 
<br>What’s important is that when you hire someone, they’re aligned with 
<br>your vision and mission.
<br>
<br>Some will say it’s a project management tool, while others call it a task list. 
<br>When people think very different things about your product, it’s important to have great messaging. It helps people explain your product to other prospective customers.
<br>
<br>If you don’t have your story and messaging right, no amount of money spent on tactics like paid acquisition will work. You’ll bring people to your product only to find a message that doesn’t resonate.

<br>SELLING TO COMPANIES OF LESS THAN 10 EMPLOYEES
<br>Characteristics:
<br>◊ The company consists of founders and engineers
<br>◊ They act like consumers because they are 
<br>spending their own money
<br>◊ Money is tight so they do everything on the cheap and build it 
<br>themselves
<br>
<br>Sales strategy:
<br>◊ Sell to them like a consumer app: no sales people 
<br>and make it all self-service
<br>◊ Devote money you would have spent on sales to marketing. 
<br>High-quality content lets you reach a much wider audience 
<br>than 50 cold calls a day, and you’ll know the people coming 
<br>in are at least slightly interested in your product
<br>SELLING TO COMPANIES OF 11-25 EMPLOYEES
<br>Characteristics:
<br>◊ The focus is still on product and engineering
<br>◊ They have started to get traction. They might have raised 
<br>funding, and so are starting to spend other people’s money
<br>◊ At this size organizations need tools and they tend to get a
<br>lot done with a few of them
<br>Sales strategy:
<br>◊ It’s a great time to get in and grow with a company; 
<br>they are willing to spend real money on tools
<br>◊ You can introduce sales now but most companies at this 
<br>size prefer self-service because the individuals making 
<br>decisions are used to doing everything themselves
<br>SELLING TO COMPANIES OF 26-75 EMPLOYEES
<br>Characteristics:
<br>◊ Another management layer is introduced and 
<br>not everyone reports to the CEO
<br>◊ As the number of employees grows, so do budgets, 
<br>process and managers
<br>Sales strategy:
<br>◊ You can add a sales team to your company to focus on this size of 
<br>firm; it’s justified by the amount of money they have to spend
<br>◊ From a sales perspective, this is often described as the best time to 
<br>start and grow with a company. It’s right before hyper-growth starts

<br>SMS was a phenomenal 
<br>technology and was liquid profit for telcos. Then a handful of engineers 
<br>got together and built WhatsApp. Within two years they’d obliterated the 
<br>majority of the growth in the most profitable part of telcos.
<br>
<br>It wasn’t clear that a phone would decimate the mapping business (tomtom, garmin), or that software would disrupt telecommunications businesses (whatsapp). 
<br>
<br>Whenever you see something new, assess whether it makes a difference 
<br>to your customers, because if it does, they’ll start using it – and you’ll 
<br>be left wondering how the ground moved beneath you. 
<br>
<br>The question you have to consistently ask yourself as new things emerge 
<br>every day is: “Does this new technology make it in any way cheaper, 
<br>faster or easier for our customers to make progress in their lives?” 
<br>
<br>DESIGN
<br>
<br>The reality is that data can introduce even more uncertainty into your 
<br>business if not used correctly. Because humans are deciding what to 
<br>measure, how to measure and why to measure, almost all data is built on 
<br>biases and judgement.
<br>
<br>For example, if Apple were driven by data, they would have shut down their 
<br>Genius Bar after years of no activity. If Ryanair were customer driven they’d 
<br>remove all their sneaky fees and charges.
<br>
<br>Early stage companies have limited resources in terms of attention, so 
<br>it’s critical to focus on data that’s important to them, not necessarily 
<br>what conventional wisdom tells them to measure. For example, If you’re 
<br>looking to disrupt a well-defined market, then you should know that the 
<br>success of your company won’t be measured by the same metrics used 
<br>by the big players in the market. Airbnb and the Hilton group have very 
<br>different definitions of success, but each are valid for their business.

<br>◊ If you want to improve your onboarding, talk to this week’s 
<br>sign-ups while the experience is fresh in their mind.
<br>◊ If you want to know how your interface scales, talk to the people 
<br>with hundreds of active projects (or galleries, libraries, etc.).
<br>◊ If you want to understand the challenges in getting 
<br>an entire team to switch to your app, talk to people 
<br>who have just added their whole team.

<br>People are generally motivated to provide unsolicited feedback if they 
<br>have an extreme experience. That’s why you see Yelp restaurant reviews 
<br>clustered around the “amazing” and “appalling” end of the spectrum. 
<br>But the night your dinner was really average? You’re probably not going 
<br>to bother writing a review because, well, what’s the point? It’s not a 
<br>very interesting story is it? When it comes to customer feedback you’ve 
<br>probably got a large group in the middle who think your product is 
<br>“fine”. These customers typically stay silent but they could have also have 
<br>useful feedback for you. If you’re smart, you’ll find ways to tease it out.

<br>If you simply rely on data, it can end up bringing you to a local maximum rather than allowing you to hit your full potential.

<br>
<br>The highest rewards come from the biggest risks. Sometimes you need 
<br>to be willing to say “We believe in this, fuck what the data says”. That’s when things gets exciting.

<br>Pursuing vanity
<br>metrics as goals
<br>- suicide
<br>
<br>Eg: Twitter has been fixated on a single metric: monthly active users. It defined it early on as a number for success, following in Facebook’s footsteps.
<br>As a result, Twitter has spent the better part of the last three years doing 
<br>everything it can to inflate that number, at the peril of its 313 million existing users. Instead of making Twitter better for the people who are already using it, it alienated its core user base by introducing features 
<br>designed to help beginners across the board – like hiding @mentions for 
<br>everyone – dumbing down the proposition for more experienced users.

<br>The number one reason customers quit is because they believe you no
<br>longer care about them. There are numerous studies that show this to be
<br>true, including the one above from the Rockefeller Corporation. 
<br>
<br>A lot of startups mistakenly think the path to customer support success is
<br>through surprising, delighting, and creating memorable experiences for
<br>your customers.
<br>
<br>Aim for low effort, not delight
<br>Shortening the path
<br>between asking a question and getting an answer lowers the objective
<br>effort required by customers. 
<br>
<br>Communication:
<br>
<br>“one big
<br>answer” - a comprehensive reply that covers every possible related scenario
<br>e.g. your answer may be five or six paragraphs long, include links to your
<br>documentation, and even have an embedded video about how to use the
<br>feature in question. It’s comprehensive but there’s no sense you want to
<br>engage in any back and forth communication with the customer.
<br>
<br>The alternative is to have a conversation with your customer – whether
<br>that’s via email, through in-app communications or over the phone. You
<br>try to get to the root of the issue and if appropriate you follow up with
<br>additional questions or advice.
<br>
<br>Create FAQs to try and proactively answer common questions customers
<br>ask. For example, you could outline a workaround for an issue many
<br>customers are experiencing. Or you could explain why you haven’t built a frequemtly requested feature.
