<br>Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to tge users' daily routines and emotions. A habit is at work when users feel a tad bored and instantly open Twitter.

<br>The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money.

<br>The fact that we have greater access to web through our various connected devices - smartphones and tablets, televisions, gameconsoles, and wearable technology - gives companies far greater ability to affect our behavior.

<br>Credit card customers tend to stay loyal for a very long time and are worth of a bundle. Hence, credit card companies are willing to spend a considerable amount of money acquiring new customers. This explains why you receive so many promotional offers, ranging from free gifts to airline bonus miles, to entice you to another card or upgrade current one.

<br>For new entrants to stand a chance, they can't be just better, they must be 9 times better. Because old habits die hard and new products need to offer dramatic improvementsto shake users out of old routines.

<br>
<br>Products that require a high degree of behavioral change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.

<br>Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamines) but once the habit is formed they become must-haves (painkillers).

<br>- What habits does your business model require?
<br>- What problem are users turning to your product to solve?
<br>- How do users currently solve that problem and why does it need a solution?
<br>- How frequently do you expect users to engage with your product?
<br>- What user behavior do you want to make into a habit?
<br>37

<br>
<br>Triggers
<br>
<br>Consider, perhaps, your emotion-cued behaviors.
<br>When bored, many people seek excitement and turn to dramatic news headlines.
<br>#
<br>When we are stressed, seek serenity, perhaps finding relief in sites like Pinterest.
<br>When we feel lonely, Facebook provide instant social connections.
<br>50
<br>
<br>The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association so that user identifies the company's product or service as the source of relief.

<br>
<br>To build a habit-forming product, makers need to understand which user emotions may be tied to internal triggers and how to leverage external triggers to drive user to action.
<br>58
<br>
<br>-----
<br>- What is the most frequent internal trigger and the habit you are designing: "Every time the user (internal trigger), he (first action of intended habit).
<br>- What is user doing right before first action of the habit?What might be places and times to send an external trigger?
<br>- Think of at least 3 conventional ways to trigger user with current technology (emails, notifications, text messages,...). Then stretch yourself to come up with at least 3 impossible ideas ( wearable computers, biometric sensors, carrier pigeons,...) Your crazy ideas can spur some new approaches that may not be so nuttyafter all.

<br>
<br>Action.
<br>
<br>Remember, a habit is a behavior done with a little or no concious thought. The more effort - physical or mental - required to perform the desired action, the less likely it is to occur.
<br>61
<br>
<br>Ingredients to initiate behavior:
<br>1. User must have sufficient motivation
<br>2. Must have ability to complete the desired action
<br>3. Trigger must be present to activate the behavior.

<br>Čo ak ti zazvonil telefón, ale mal si ho v taške a trvalo by ti, kým by si ho vytiahol (lack of ability). Čo ak by si ho vytiahol a zistil, že volá telemarketer (lack of motivation)? Čo ak by si ho aj mal poruke, aj chcel zodvihnúť, ale nepočul by si, lebo si mal vypnuté zvonenia? (Chýbal by spúšťač)
<br>62
<br>
<br>Motivácia môže byť pozitívna - vidím šťastných, úspešných ľudí, chcem byť ako oni, budem robiť to, čo robia oni. 
<br>Ale silnými motivátormi sú aj negatívne emócie - napríklad človek po nehode, vyvarujem sa jeho chýb.

<br>Na začiatku webu sa ľudia pripájali dialupom. Odpojili telefón, zapojili modem, čakali minútu a boli online. Internet bol pomalý a všetko sa načítavalo večnosť.
<br>Ľudia už v tom čase radi blogovali. Ak chcel niekto blogovať musel si v tom svete kúpiť doménu, hosting, nastaviť DNS a CMS.
<br>Potom prišiel Blogger. Stačilo si len vytvoriť konto a mohol som začať blogovať.
<br>Potom prišiel Twitter. Kým blogovanie bolo stále náročné, zaberalo veľa času, na Twittri mohol mikroblogovať krátke správy hocikto a okamžite.
<br>Pinterest, Instagram posúvajú jednoduchosť ešte ďalej. Just a quick snap of a photo or repin of an interesting image shares information across multiple social networks.
<br>71
<br>
<br>Elements of simplicity:
<br>- time
<br>- money - the fiscal cost of taking an action
<br>- physical effort
<br>- brain cycles - the level of mental effortand focus required to take an action

<br>B. J. Fogg's Behavior Model:
<br>- For any behavior to occur, a trigger must be present at the same time as the user has sufficient motivation to take action.
<br>- every behavior is driven by one of the three Core Motivators: seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, seeking hope and avoiding fear, social acceptance while avoiding social rejection.
<br>- ability is influenced by the 6 factors of time, money, physical effort, brain cycles (too confusing), social deviance (outside the norm), and non-routineness (too new).

<br>Rewards of the Tribe.
<br>Stack Overflow.
<br>Many of responses provide detailed, highly-technical and time consuming answers. But why do people spend so much time doing all this work for free? What motivates them?
<br>It works because software engineers find satisfaction in contributing to community they care about.
<br>Rewards confer special value by representing how much someone has contributed to his tribe. 
<br>104
<br>
<br>Only by understanding what truly matters to users can a company correctly match the right variable reward to their intended behavior.
<br>Pri Q&A payouty nie sú motivátorom. Prichádzajú nepravidelne a v malých množstvách. Quora si uvedomila, že ľuďom ide o social impact and recognition.

<br>
<br>Gamification.
<br>- nie je to niečo, čo pasuje každému
<br>- when there's a mismatch between the customer's problem and company's assumed solution, no amoit of gamification will help
<br>- if user has no interest in product offered, no ongoing itch at all, gamification will fail
<br>- gamification rewards are not magic fairy dust that instantly makes products attractive.
<br>- rewards must be aligned with narrative why is lroduct used and align with triggers and motivations.

<br>It's easy to see how they get someone hooked. Fitocracy is first and foremost an online community. 
<br>The ritual of connecting with like-minded people existed long before and company leverages this behavior by making it easier and more rewarding to share encouragement, change advice and receive praise. 
<br>In fact, a study revealed that social factors were the most important reasons people used the service and recommended to others.

<br>
<br>Make new tools and features available in your app as people develop their habits.
<br>123
<br>
<br>Companies fail because they don't make their services enjoyable, often ask users to learn new, unfamiliar actions instead of making old routines easier.
<br>124
<br>
<br>To change behavior, products must ensure the users feel control - people must want to use the service, not feel they have to.

<br>Finite experience - an experience that becomes predictable after use.
<br>These experiences become less engaging.
<br>Games played for completion offer finite variability, while those played with other people have higher degree of maintaining user interest by sustaining variability.
