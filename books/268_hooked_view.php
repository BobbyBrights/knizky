<br>The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money.

<br>Credit card customers tend to stay loyal for a very long time and are worth of a bundle. Hence, credit card companies are willing to spend a considerable amount of money acquiring new customers. This explains why you receive so many promotional offers, ranging from free gifts to airline bonus miles, to entice you to another card or upgrade current one.

<br>For new entrants to stand a chance, they can't be just better, they must be 9 times better. Because old habits die hard and new products need to offer dramatic improvementsto shake users out of old routines.

<br>Products that require a high degree of behavioral change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.

<br>Qwerty klávesnice vznikli v 1870s pre písacie stroje. Layout bol navrhnutý tak, aby zabránil vzpriečeniu - jamming the metal bars. Napriek physical limitation zostáva najpoužívanejším layoutom, hoci existujú aj lepšie.

<br>Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamines) but once the habit is formed they become must-haves (painkillers).

<br>- What habits does your business model require?
<br>- What problem are users turning to your product to solve?
<br>- How do users currently solve that problem and why does it need a solution?
<br>- How frequently do you expect users to engage with your product?
<br>- What user behavior do you want to make into a habit?

<br>
<br>Triggers
<br>
<br>Consider, perhaps, your emotion-cued behaviors.
<br>When bored, many people seek excitement and turn to dramatic news headlines.
<br>#
<br>When we are stressed, seek serenity, perhaps finding relief in sites like Pinterest.
<br>When we feel lonely, Facebook provide instant social connections.
<br>50
<br>
<br>The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association so that user identifies the company's product or service as the source of relief.

<br>To build a habit-forming product, makers need to understand which user emotions may be tied to internal triggers and how to leverage external triggers to drive user to action.
<br>58
<br>
<br>-----
<br>- What is the most frequent internal trigger and the habit you are designing: "Every time the user (internal trigger), he (first action of intended habit).
<br>- What is user doing right before first action of the habit?What might be places and times to send an external trigger?
<br>- Think of at least 3 conventional ways to trigger user with current technology (emails, notifications, text messages,...). Then stretch yourself to come up with at least 3 impossible ideas ( wearable computers, biometric sensors, carrier pigeons,...) Your crazy ideas can spur some new approaches that may not be so nuttyafter all.

<br>
<br>Action.
<br>
<br>Remember, a habit is a behavior done with a little or no concious thought. The more effort - physical or mental - required to perform the desired action, the less likely it is to occur.
<br>61
<br>
<br>Ingredients to initiate behavior:
<br>1. User must have sufficient motivation
<br>2. Must have ability to complete the desired action
<br>3. Trigger must be present to activate the behavior.

<br>Čo ak ti zazvonil telefón, ale mal si ho v taške a trvalo by ti, kým by si ho vytiahol (lack of ability). Čo ak by si ho vytiahol a zistil, že volá telemarketer (lack of motivation)? Čo ak by si ho aj mal poruke, aj chcel zodvihnúť, ale nepočul by si, lebo si mal vypnuté zvonenia? (Chýbal by spúšťač)
<br>62
<br>
<br>Motivácia môže byť pozitívna - vidím šťastných, úspešných ľudí, chcem byť ako oni, budem robiť to, čo robia oni. 
<br>Ale silnými motivátormi sú aj negatívne emócie - napríklad človek po nehode, vyvarujem sa jeho chýb.

<br>The pattern of innovation shows that making a given action easier to accomplish turns formerly niche behavior into a mainstream habit.

<br>Na začiatku webu sa ľudia pripájali dialupom. Odpojili telefón, zapojili modem, čakali minútu a boli online. Internet bol pomalý a všetko sa načítavalo večnosť.
<br>Ľudia už v tom čase radi blogovali. Ak chcel niekto blogovať musel si v tom svete kúpiť doménu, hosting, nastaviť DNS a CMS.
<br>Potom prišiel Blogger. Stačilo si len vytvoriť konto a mohol som začať blogovať.
<br>Potom prišiel Twitter. Kým blogovanie bolo stále náročné, zaberalo veľa času, na Twittri mohol mikroblogovať krátke správy hocikto a okamžite.
<br>Pinterest, Instagram posúvajú jednoduchosť ešte ďalej. Just a quick snap of a photo or repin of an interesting image shares information across multiple social networks.

<br>Elements of simplicity:
<br>- time
<br>- money - the fiscal cost of taking an action
<br>- physical effort
<br>- brain cycles - the level of mental effortand focus required to take an action
